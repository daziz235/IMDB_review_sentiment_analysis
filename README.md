IMDB_review_sentiment_analysis

The IMDB website provided 50K movie reviews for this dataset. This is a binary sentiment classification dataset. Our goal is to use deep learning methods such as LSTM recurrent neural networks or classification techniques to forecast the quantity of positive and negative reviews. We create sequential long short-term memory neural networks (LSTM) with dense layers, LSTM layers, spatial dropout, and embedding for sequence tasks handling sequences of length 250 and utilizing around 5 million parameters.
